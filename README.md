# MicroPython-CodeMash2024-ShakeTable
Micro Python code for automating a shaketable.  The physical servos weren't powerful enough for the table in the current iteration.
Different servos along with more testing is needed.  Possibly use a piston to drive the movement on the table instead of back and forth movement from the servo.
